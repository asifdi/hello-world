# hello-world
my git training repository
Hi all, Am wondering in the depths of git and the coding world
I like to code in Julia, though Python bought me to the coding world
I wish to create something that is essentially useful to mankind, but taking baby steps
creating something which is useful for my own and then the near circle.
